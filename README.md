* Deep learning has been proven to be superior in detecting and localizing defects using imagery data which could significantly improve the production efficiency in the manufacturing industry.
* Built a model to automate the process of detecting and localizing defects found in Steel manufacturing.
* Detecting defects would help in improving the quality of manufacturing as well as in reducing the waste due to production defects.
